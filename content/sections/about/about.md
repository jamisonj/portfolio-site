I am a diligent, detail-oriented, and dedicated full stack software developer with the ability to produce high quality work. I value user-centered design, simplicity, efficiency, security, privacy, and visual appeal. I strongly believe in best practices and well-designed processes - the way in which the work is done is as important as the work itself. I value learning, and enjoy mentoring others.

I am guided by a strong code of ethics that drives me in my motivation to help make the world a better place. 

If you are seeking someone with these qualities, you want me on your team.
